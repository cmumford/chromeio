# chromeio

Script to analyze File I/O for the Chrome web browser. This script is _mostly_
platform agnostic. However, it is currently designed to read output produced by
Process Monitor, so at present this is a Windows only tool.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Process Monitor](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx).
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Gathering File I/O

1. Start Process Monitor. You will be presented with a "Process Monitor Filter"
   dialog. In order to only filter Chrome events you will want to add a filter
   rule: "Process Name + contains + chrome".
2. Press the OK button to begin capturing I/O events.
3. Uncheck File&#8594;Capture Events to cease the capture process.

## Analyzing I/O

Once you have a capture to analyze you will need to export the log as a CSV file.

1. Make sure "Time of Day" is the first column.
2. File&#8594;Save (CSV).

Now that you have the CSV file you are ready to run this tool.

    python chromeio &lt;path/to/Logfile.CSV&gt;

Here is an example report:

python chromeio.py path/to/Logfile.CSV
